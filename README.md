    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    What did you do particularly well?
    Where could you improve?

    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
    How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

    In this project we untilizaed a CC3220 board to check the temperature and if the temperature wasnt high enough it would turn on an LED representing heat turning on for a thermistat when the temperature in a room gets too low. 

    Honestly this wasn't my finest work as I was dealing with lots of issues in my life from a motorcycle accident to having to find new housing but in the end I think I meet the criteria and made a functioning program.

    The biggest recource I need to add are time management to make sure I'm submitting work on time.

    The most useful thing from this class is getting use to using multiple libraries and use of timers and other such funtions when working with embedded systems.

    Because I rushed a lot I didnt comment a ton but I think the code is clear and could be updated when needed.
